Track down the keypad irregularities
Random from HW is not working, need to insert the library and tweak
Seems to be stuck on the mnemonic screen. No keys get it off that.

Reflashed, since eeprom is external this does not wiipe the wallets (or the prefs)

At PIN entry.... no keys detected on the blind entry
Only the check key ackd
Ah, it has no feedback until check selected. OK past the PIN.... stuck on the checkmark, probably frobbed on the usartinit
OK, traced all the way to where it initializes the BLE (not) and the USB (wrong ports)
If am to here, then can socket in the 16u2 and let's flash that beast. Will be OK to use that while figuring out the Native USB and the BLE
(previously both were UARTs)

hw_rng is working. 
Display of the seed is still frobbed up.
Needed to update the compiler to the latest 2017 edition manually, as the 0.9.3 adafruit does not include it.
